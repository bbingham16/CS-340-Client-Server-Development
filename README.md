# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  o	The advantages of using the CRUD Python module allow code to be added to allow greater functionality across multiple different files. The code was written in a maintainable, readable yet adaptable way so that it could be utilized across various files for the same functionality. Using the CRUD Python module allowed the users to query for one or many different results using the criteria they were looking for. If in the future, the developer wanted to change the code and search for cats in a certain age group, the criteria could be changed without even touching the CRUD Python module that had already been created.


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  o	I was able to implement the criteria the company was searching for in different breeds for different rescues using the CRUD Python module. Knowing exactly what the client wants and how they want the functionality to act makes all the difference in how you develop the program.  This approach was slightly different because we were using a CRUD Python module to assist in the queries, whereas in other programs we would just create the code in one place and not use the CRUD module. This was a different but efficient perspective, and a great visualization of how this CRUD Python module can be reusable for other files.


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  o	The company assists in rescue efforts to save people. Having an application to help narrow down dogs that can aid in those efforts is beneficial and necessary to have. Computer scientists create tools for users that make tasks in the users lives easier. This is why understanding what the user needs and expects in an application is everything to the success of the finished product.
